It is important to note that content types are extremely helpful as they provide standardized guidelines to go about documentation, but thay can be customized as necessary. Additionally, technical writers must undertake to get to know their audience and their needs (with the help from other relevant stakeholders such as Product Owners) before setting about to using fixed templates for documentation.
